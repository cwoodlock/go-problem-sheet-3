# Go-problem-sheet-03
This is from the third problem sheet for data representation and querying. In this exercise we were asked to use regular expressions.

I am Colm Woodlock, student number G00341460 and this is my submission.

## How to run Golang files

 1. First download go from: https://golang.org/dl/
 2. Then clone my github repository using git clone https://github.com/cwoodlock/go-problem-sheet-2.git
 3. Then in the Command Line cd into the directory with the go files and type:
 
    go run filename.go	

## Testing
Since this is a web application you will be able to see the result at htttp://localhost:8080

### cURL

 cURL is also an option to see the code in action, simply download cURL here : https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
    
 
 Then run the command : curl -I http://localhost:8080
